            <h2>Last semester starts now.</h2>
            <p>Well, not right now exactly, but definitely very soon. To be perfectly honest, it makes me nervous even though I'm confident I'll do even better this year than the last. Its what lies ahead of school, even if it is just more school, that I'm afraid of.
                <br> I've got really not much else to add, but I'm applying for junior (insert programming title here) jobs all over. Thanks for reading, even if it is just me in the future.

            <h2>Made the website.</h2>
            <p>Finally made the website. What to put on it? I guess skills... accomplishments... hopes and dreams? ...Not exactly sure yet. When more is going on maybe I can use it as a resume or portfolio type-beat. Until then, I'll probably focus on making
                irl $ and improving this little site. I'll do occassional updates here, really for no other reason than to personally track progress. <br> aaand that's about all I got.</p>
